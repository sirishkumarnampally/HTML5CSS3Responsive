				<h3>Batsman</h3>
				<p>Batting is the act or skill of hitting the cricket ball with a cricket bat to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. ... When a batsman is out, he is replaced by a teammate.</p>

					<h3>Bowler</h3>
					<p>Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batsman. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler; a bowler who is also a competent batsman is known as an all-rounder. ... Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over.</p>

						<h3>All Rounder</h3>
					<p>	An all-rounder is a cricketer who regularly performs well at both batting and bowling. Although all bowlers must bat and quite a few batsmen do bowl occasionally, most players are skilled in only one of the two disciplines and are considered specialists. Some wicket-keepers have the skills of a specialist batsman and have been referred to as all-rounders, but the term wicketkeeper-batsman is more commonly applied to them, even if they are substitute wicketkeepers who also bowl.</p>
